I like that c++ offers a greater amount of control than other languages. Being able to choose to pass by ref, pass by value, or 
pass by pointer just gives you the ability to select the right tool for the job. That is also what makes it more difficult to 
understand both conceptually and from a syntax point of view. 

I didn't really understand why we were instructed to use an array of enums... we're storing data in arrays which makes sense but the values are all just 0 - n and we don't ever really need to reference a named value where an enum makes sense.

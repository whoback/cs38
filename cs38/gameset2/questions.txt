1. A few:
More experimenting with the colors... worked on it for a bit and due to needing to detect diff in system / terminals its pretty complicated.
Hint system would be interesting at the cost of a guess the user would get a hint as to the answer perhaps a synonym
easy multiplayer - allow someone to enter a word for another to guess and vice versa then users alternate guesses.. 1st one to guess entire word wins

2.refactoring and getting logic to where I wanted it.
